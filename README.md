How to Play
Launch the Emoji Game App.
Initially, the score and total score for the current game will be set to 0.
You will see a grid of emojis on the screen.
Click on any emoji in the grid.
If it is not the same as any of the previously clicked emojis, your score will be incremented by one.
If it is the same as any of the previously clicked emojis, you will lose the game.
Continue clicking on emojis until you either win or lose.
If you click on all the emojis exactly once, you will win the game.
If you click on the same emoji twice, you will lose the game.
If you win the game, the "Won Game" view will be displayed.
If you lose the game, the "Lose Game" view will be displayed.
If your score in the current game is higher than the previous top score, the top score will be updated accordingly.
To play again, simply click the "Play Again" button.
The score value will be reset to 0 for the new game.
The top score value will be retained.
